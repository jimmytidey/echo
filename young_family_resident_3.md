As a newcomer to Smallfields, I feel genuinely apprehensive about the proposed development near Chapel Road. Moving here was a deliberate choice, prompted by the desire for a serene, family-oriented community, free from the bustle of city life. The idea of this development jeopardizing that peacefulness is indeed troubling.

The first issue of concern is the housing market's impact. At the moment, house prices are already quite high, and any further increase due to new developments could place owning a home out of reach for many families like mine. It's essential that any development maintains affordability, enabling families to think about putting down roots rather than solely targeting upscale markets.

From an environmental perspective, Smallfields is a haven of greenery and natural beauty, something all new construction should strive to protect. New developments should include sustainable landscaping plans that prioritize keeping existing green spaces, protecting trees, and enhancing our local environment, rather than overshadowing them with concrete and tall buildings. The transition into a concrete jungle wouldn't just impact our views but also the local biodiversity that thrives here.

Furthermore, infrastructure and traffic management are key areas of concern. With the population potentially increasing, can our existing roads handle the uptick without causing congestion, safety issues, or disruption? Thoughtful addition of footpaths and cycle paths can enhance connectivity in the community, but they shouldn’t compromise our everyday peace. Parking facilities also require strategic planning to ensure they don't reduce existing greenery or inconvenience current residents.

In summary, development is necessary, but I urge for a strategy that respects the character, space, and affordability of Smallfields. Our local authorities need to work inclusively, taking into account the voices of newer residents like myself to forge a plan that preserves the village’s unique essence while fostering sustainable growth. The focus should be on enhancing the community spirit and infrastructure, with a commitment that new developments are in harmony with the current character and charm that drew us here in the first place.
