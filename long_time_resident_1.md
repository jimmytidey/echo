As a long-time resident of Smallfields, I'm quite concerned about the proposed development near Chapel Road. I moved here many years ago to enjoy the peaceful, village-like environment that Smallfields offers, and I’m worried about how this development might change the character of the area. One of my main concerns is how the new development might impact the value of our homes. My home is my largest asset and I’ve spent years maintaining it; I would hate for its value to decrease because of increased traffic or overcrowding from new developments nearby.

I’m also worried about how this development might affect our local environment. We are lucky to have such lovely natural surroundings, and I fear losing that to more concrete and buildings. Important features like trees and green spaces should be protected. I can only hope that any new development plans include proper landscaping and retention of our current green spaces.

Furthermore, the increase in footpaths and cycle paths could be beneficial, but only if they’re carefully planned. We need to make sure there’s no overdevelopment with regards to density and design, as that could lead to congestion. Parking and safety are also crucial issues. With more people potentially moving to the area, there must be adequate parking without taking away from existing residents or causing more congestion. It’s also essential that any new development adheres to safety standards to ensure our community remains safe and serene.

While I understand the need for progress and new housing, any development should carefully consider the village’s current character and not compromise the essence of why Smallfields is such a wonderful place to live. The Council should listen to long-time residents like us to ensure this development is beneficial for everyone, not just profit-driven developers.
