As a recent arrival in Smallfields, I'm truly concerned about the proposed development near Chapel Road. Moving here was a decision rooted in finding a peaceful, family-friendly spot, but these plans are stirring up worry about maintaining the village charm and affordable housing.

Firstly, the impact on house prices is a major worry. With the current market already skyrocketing, any development should not inflate housing costs further, making it impossible for families like mine to consider long-term settling. Home ownership seems like a distant dream; developments should be considerate to keep this community affordable and accessible, not just cater to upscale markets.

The environmental aspect is another matter close to my heart. We're lucky to enjoy such beautiful natural surroundings, and it's crucial that any new construction minimizes environmental disruption. Keeping ample green spaces, protecting existing trees, and ensuring new landscaping is integral to the plans should be a priority. Concrete jungles aren't what families envision when they think of home, and losing our charming greenery would be a significant loss.

Traffic and infrastructure are pressing concerns, too. With potential for increased population, can the current roads handle more traffic without creating congestion and safety issues? The introduction of more well-thought footpaths and cycle paths sounds ideal for connectivity, but it mustn't come at the cost of our everyday peace and accessibility. Parking, for instance, needs careful planning so it does not infringe upon our current setups or consume more green areas.

Ultimately, while I understand the need for new housing, such developments must thoughtfully preserve what's wonderful about Smallfields. The character, the open spaces, and the affordability shouldn't be sacrificed at the altar of progress. So, I hope our council takes these into account and ensures any changes align with enhancing rather than eroding the community spirit. It's vital they listen to residents like me to create a strategy that benefits everyone, keeping the essence of Smallfields alive for future generations.
