As a long-time resident of Smallfields, I'm truly concerned about the proposed development near Chapel Road. This village has been my home for many years, cherished for its tranquility and the close-knit community atmosphere. The idea of change is always a bit worrying, especially when it might impact the essence of our beloved home.

First and foremost, the potential effect on property values is a pressing concern. For most of us, our homes are our largest assets, and we've invested time and effort into maintaining them. The thought of these values dropping due to increased traffic or overcrowding from a new development is unsettling. It's important that any new projects carefully consider how they might influence property values, making sure they don't negatively affect the investments long-time residents have made.

Equally troubling is the effect on our local environment. Smallfields is beautiful, with its lush greenery and natural appeal. We must protect the trees, plants, and green spaces that make this area so delightful. They shouldn't be sacrificed for concrete buildings and roads. I hope any development plans include comprehensive landscaping to preserve as much of our natural environment as possible.

Regarding infrastructure, I worry if our current roads and facilities can handle a surge of newcomers without causing more congestion or safety concerns. While improved footpaths and cycle lanes can be beneficial, they should be thoughtfully implemented so they don't spoil our locality's accessibility and serenity. Parking also needs careful attention, ensuring it doesn't take away from current residents or intrude on green spaces.

Even though I understand the demand for new housing, I hope developments will respect what makes Smallfields special. The village's character, open spaces, and the overall peaceful environment are not things we want to lose. It's crucial that the council listens to residents like myself and ensures developments benefit the community as a whole, rather than merely satisfying external development interests. The spirit of Smallfields is valuable, and I hope we keep that in the forefront while considering future developments.
