# Smallfield and Burstow Neighbourhood Plan (2022–2042) Summary

## 🏡 Vision

Burstow Parish, especially Smallfield, aims to remain a thriving, safe, friendly rural community. The vision includes:
- Retaining open countryside, green space, and rural character.
- Ensuring new development is sustainable and enhances quality of life.
- Supporting community services, flood resilience, and appropriate housing for all ages.

## 🎯 Objectives

1. Protect Green Belt and rural character.
2. Prevent coalescence with Horley and Copthorne.
3. Ensure new development mitigates flood risk and supports infrastructure.
4. Promote housing that fits local character and offers affordability.
5. Support existing businesses and digital connectivity.
6. Improve road safety, traffic, and parking.
7. Conserve heritage and landscape views.

## 🌍 Context and Setting

- Burstow Parish includes Smallfield (main settlement), Copthorne Bank, Weatherhill Common, and others.
- It has 4,536 residents in 1,679 households across 11.39 km².
- Situated close to Gatwick, the M23, and major urban centres.
- Characterized by Green Belt land, flat topography, and susceptibility to flooding.
- Smallfield is growing and has a central role in services and housing.

## 🛠 Land Use Policies

### Flooding
- **F1-F8**: Mandate separate foul/surface water systems, SUDS with lifetime plans, greywater recycling, and floodplain protection. Developments must not increase flood risk.

### Housing
- **H1-H11**: Encourage small, affordable homes, low-to-medium density, rural character, varied styles, gardens, and green verges. Limit height to 2.5 storeys and oppose backland development.

### Transport
- **TT1-TT6**: Promote walking/cycling, improve dangerous junctions, support central parking with EV chargers, and manage HGV impacts.

### Green Spaces
- **GS1-GS4**: Protect Local Green Spaces, rural character, and green gaps between settlements.

### Heritage & Environment
- **HE1**: Encourage tree planting and protect historic settings and views.

### Communications
- **C1**: Improve mobile and digital infrastructure.

### Infrastructure Contributions
- **AI1**: Establish a fund from developments (20+ homes) for local amenity upgrades.

## 🏠 Housing Aspirations

- Support affordable homes, including bungalows and 1–2 bed units.
- Prioritize homes for local people and encourage varied tenure: ownership, shared, and rental.
- Integrate affordable housing within communities to avoid segregation.
- Reflect local architecture: clay roofs, tile hanging, porches, and gardens.
- Ensure generous space standards and future-proofed designs (e.g. accessibility).

## 🌊 Flood Risk Focus

Flooding is the community’s top concern due to past severe events (e.g., 2013–14, 2022). Key policies:
- Prevent developments in flood-prone areas.
- Upgrade Burstow sewage infrastructure.
- Prioritize SUDS, natural drainage, and protection of functional floodplains.
- Oppose developments that shift risk onto existing homes.

## 🚲 Transport Issues

- Smallfield’s narrow roads are overwhelmed by commuter and HGV traffic.
- Critical bottlenecks: Wheelers Lane/Redehall Road/Plough Road junction.
- Local Plan growth and Gatwick’s expansion may exacerbate congestion.
- Cycling infrastructure is under pressure, with routes like the London–Brighton ride adding up to 15,000 cyclists in a day.

## 💼 Employment

- Encourage local jobs to reduce commuting and congestion.
- Support rural businesses, reuse of disused farm buildings, and remote work.
- Resist speculative airport parking and unsustainable business uses.
- Emphasize tech and services over manufacturing.

## 🧭 Policy Context

- The Neighbourhood Plan aligns with the NPPF and Tandridge District’s 2008 Core Strategy and 2014 Local Plan (Part 2).
- Policies cover housing mix, affordable housing, density, biodiversity, flood risk, and the Green Belt.
- The plan reflects local concerns about developer pressure and offers a framework for sustainable growth.

## 🗺 Preferred Development Sites

Following assessment of 13 potential sites, 3 are supported:
1. **Bridgeham Farm** – 25 homes
2. **Land at May Cottage** – 100 homes
3. **Land North of Plough Road** – 120 homes

These sites are seen as more sustainable, dispersed, and less impactful on infrastructure, flood risk, and the Green Belt.

## 🧾 Sustainability Approach

The Plan promotes sustainable development by balancing:
- **Economic**: Encouraging local business and innovation.
- **Social**: Providing housing, health, and community facilities.
- **Environmental**: Protecting the landscape, enhancing biodiversity, and reducing flood and climate risks.

## 📌 Conclusion

The Burstow Neighbourhood Plan seeks to:
- Guide development in a way that protects the rural character of Smallfield and surrounding hamlets.
- Ensure infrastructure keeps pace with growth.
- Encourage affordable, attractive housing that meets community needs.
- Preserve the distinctiveness of the village in the face of mounting development pressures.

By adopting this plan, the community retains a say in shaping its future and avoids being overwhelmed by speculative, poorly integrated development.
