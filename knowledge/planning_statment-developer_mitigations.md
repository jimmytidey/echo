## 2. Transport and Road Safety Improvements

- **Speed Limit Reduction**: Chapel Road proposed to be reduced to 20mph throughout its length.

## Conclusion

Rydon Homes has proactively sought to address resident concerns through a multi-faceted strategy including:

- Meaningful engagement and consultation.
- Significant investment in highways, drainage, and green infrastructure.
- Provision for long-term community needs (e.g., education, housing, public space).
- A flexible, sustainable, and design-led approach to growth on a constrained but strategically important site.

While Green Belt development often raises objections, the Planning Statement argues that these measures—especially in the context of Tandridge’s housing crisis—constitute “very special circumstances” sufficient to justify approval.
