# Smallfield Design Code Summary

## 📘 Introduction

The Smallfield Design Code guides future development on a 15-hectare site west of Chapel Road, at the village’s northern edge. Prepared in November 2023, it supports the planning application by providing clear design parameters. Its aims are to:

- Improve certainty and speed in planning.
- Encourage high-quality placemaking.
- Help the community engage with the development process.

The Design Code supports the Framework Masterplan and follows national guidance including the National Design Guide and National Model Design Code.

## 🏞 Context and Vision

### Site Overview
The site lies within the Green Belt and is currently grassland. Key constraints include:
- Flooding and drainage issues, especially to the west and south-west.
- Retention of mature boundary trees.
- Overhead power lines requiring development offsets.
- Existing hedgerows and public rights of way.

### Vision
- A landscape-led masterplan using open space for recreation and flood mitigation.
- Potential land for relocating Burstow Primary School.
- Provision of ~270 high-quality homes.
- Pedestrian-first layout connecting to the village and countryside.

## 🧭 Framework Masterplan

The masterplan is structured around 12 key features including:

1. **Northern Gateway**: Main vehicle entrance.
2. **Pedestrian & Green Corridors**: East-west and north-south routes linking bridleways, Chapel Road, open spaces, and the proposed school.
3. **SUDs Integration**: Sustainable drainage woven into open spaces.
4. **Land Uses**: Housing at varying densities, education land, and multifunctional green spaces.

Streets are structured with a clear hierarchy:
- **Primary streets** form loops.
- **Homezones** and **edge lanes** serve smaller clusters.
- **Pedestrian priority routes** emphasize safety and walkability.

## 🚶 Movement and Access

Pedestrian and cycle access is prioritized:
- Key routes link Chapel Road, bridleways, and internal green spaces.
- Pedestrian-friendly frontages reduce vehicle crossovers.
- Dedicated cycle and pedestrian accesses are distributed across site edges.

Vehicle access is limited to two points from Chapel Road, with priority given to preserving the existing tree line.

## 🚗 Parking Strategy

A mix of parking solutions ensures flexibility:
- **On-plot** (side and frontage) and **rear courtyard** options.
- **Visitor bays** integrated into landscaping.
- Clear demarcation between allocated/unallocated spaces.
- All homes to have EV charging in line with Surrey guidance.

## 🚴 Cycle Parking

Cycle parking must be:
- Secure, covered, and as convenient as car parking.
- Integrated into building footprints or nearby overlooked areas.
- Provided for both residents and visitors.
- Located close to entrances and key destinations (e.g. school square).

## 🗑 Waste & Recycling

Provision must:
- Meet Tandridge District standards.
- Be accessible without disrupting the streetscape.
- Allow for curbside collection.
- Be integrated into private gardens or screened communal stores.

## 🌳 Landscape & Open Space

A nature-led strategy underpins the development:
- Retention of existing trees and enhancement of green corridors.
- Biodiversity-focused planting with native species.
- Layered planting to create varied habitats.
- Public open space and play integrated into the landscape.
- Buffer planting to protect ancient woodland and overhead cables.

**Street furniture** will be timber and boundaries will reflect local character (brick walls, timber fencing).

## 🧒 Children’s Play

A **Local Equipped Area for Play (LEAP)** is planned:
- At least 400 sqm with 6 pieces of equipment.
- Located 20m from dwellings.
- Includes seating, planting, and safe fencing.

Natural play and informal recreation will also be encouraged across open spaces.

## 🏠 Urban Design Principles

### Block Frontages & Edges
- Continuous frontages define street character.
- Rear gardens and boundary walls must be minimal in public views.
- Buildings must address corners and edges clearly and actively.

### Legibility
- Corners, key views, and junctions marked by “statement buildings”.
- Buildings must hold corners and terminate vistas attractively.
- Garages are not allowed on corners.

### Streetscape & Roofscape
- Varied rooflines and building forms avoid monotony.
- Use of gables, chimneys, and material variation enhances character.
- 3D modelling is encouraged for street design.

## 🎨 Local Character and Materials

Materials must reflect local vernacular:
- Brick (red, buff, burnt stock), tile hanging, and timber boarding.
- Roofs in clay or slate tiles.
- Timber porches, bay windows, and arched headers.
- Colour palettes include white, grey, sage green accents.

## 🏘 Character Areas

Six distinct character zones provide tailored guidance:

### 1. Village Arrival
- Northern gateway with informal layout.
- Low-density detached/semi-detached houses.
- Green framed arrival with public art or signage.

### 2. Green Streets
- Wide avenues (Northern, Central, School Avenues).
- Higher density with apartments and terraces.
- Green verges, swales, and safe pedestrian zones.

### 3. Chapel Road Frontage
- Respect existing hedgerows and character of eastern edge.
- Two-storey detached/semi-detached houses.
- Footpaths and shared surfaces behind existing vegetation.

### 4. Homezones
- Intimate streets with shared surfaces.
- Terraced and semi-detached housing.
- High density with limited vehicle access and defined boundaries.

### 5. Northern Open Space
- Large-scale green space and attenuation area.
- Buildings side-on to pylons with defensible planting.
- Detached and semi-detached homes, two-storeys max.

### 6. Western Corridor
- Facing bridleway and mature tree line.
- Mixed housing types (terraces, detached, small flats).
- Attenuation features and varied public space nodes.
- Buildings up to 2.5 storeys at key corners.

## 🛠 Implementation

A **compliance checklist** is provided for Reserved Matters applications to ensure all aspects of the Code are followed, including:
- Movement and access.
- Urban and landscape design.
- Character area-specific principles.

## 📌 Conclusion

The Smallfield Design Code sets out a comprehensive, place-based framework for delivering a sustainable and locally sensitive extension to the village. By integrating landscape, movement, character and built form, it ensures the development will be both functional and distinctive, enhancing the existing community and environment.
