# Transport Assessment – Key Local Impacts by Location (Smallfield Development)

This document summarises the location-specific impacts from the proposed housing development at Land West of Chapel Road, based on the submitted Transport Assessment.

---

## 🛣️ Chapel Road (adjacent to the site)

- Two **new priority access junctions** for the development.
- A **new zebra crossing** will be located outside the safeguarded school site.
- A **20mph speed limit** will be introduced along the full length of Chapel Road and Redehall Road within the village centre.
- A **2m footway** will be added along the western side toward the village centre.
- Northern access junction to act as a **new village gateway**.

---

## 🔄 Chapel Road / Redehall Road / Weatherhill Road Mini Roundabout (Junction 2)

- Junction operates within capacity in **all future scenarios**.
- Modest increases in queue and delay:
  - **Max delay:** ~14 seconds
  - **Max RFC:** 0.69
- Performance remains **acceptable** even with proposed development and SCC scheme.

---

## 🛑 Plough Road / Redehall Road / Wheelers Lane Crossroads (Junction 3)

- Forecast **capacity issues** by 2034, especially for:
  - **Right turns from Plough Road:** up to **77.8s delay**, RFC 0.86
- **SCC Wheelers Lane Scheme**:
  - **Exit-only** restriction westbound on Wheelers Lane.
  - **New zebra crossing** and public car park south of Wheelers Lane.
  - **Widened pavements** to improve pedestrian access.

---

## 📍 Norman’s Road / Rookery Hill Junction (Junction 4)

- Minimal impact forecast.
- Junction operates well within capacity:
  - RFC remains below 0.54 in all assessed conditions.

---

## 🏫 Safeguarded School Site (off Chapel Road)

- If delivered as a 3-form entry school with nursery:
  - Up to **277 vehicle trips (two-way)** in the **AM peak hour**.
  - Internal **drop-off area** assumed to absorb 40% of car arrivals.
  - Expected to place **pressure on Chapel Road access** in mornings.

---

## 🚗 Broadbridge Lane & Weatherhill Road

- Will carry **diverted traffic** following Wheelers Lane westbound closure.
- No major upgrades proposed, but models show **increased volumes** from redistributed trips.

---

## 🛣️ Regional Routes: M23 & M25

- **M23 Junction 10**: ~21–22 two-way trips in peak – **negligible impact**.
- **M25 Junction 6**: ~12–13 two-way trips – **not a concern for National Highways**.

---

All scenarios use a future year of **2034** and include cumulative background growth and committed developments (e.g. Plough Road scheme).
