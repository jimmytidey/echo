## 🧠 Interpretation

Older homeowners are more likely to **oppose** development due to:

- Concerns about **changes to local character**
- Perceived **lack of personal benefit**
- **Skepticism about build quality or overdevelopment**

However, support could be improved with:

- Tangible improvements to **local healthcare and transport**
- Clear demonstration of **design quality and infrastructure investment**
- Reassurance about **maintaining green space and community integrity**
