# Environmental Impacts by Location – Smallfield Development

This document summarises key environmental impacts by location, based on the Environmental Statement Volumes 1–3 for the proposed development at Land West of Chapel Road, Smallfield.

---

## 🏘️ Careys Close & Careys Wood (South of Site)
- **Noise:** Temporary *Minor Adverse* impact during construction (max ~70 dB(A)); minor increases from construction traffic.
- **Air Quality:** No predicted exceedances of NO₂ or PM. Construction dust to be controlled via mitigation.
- **Visual Impact:** *Major Adverse* initially, improving over time due to landscaping.
- **Flood Risk:** *Significant Beneficial* impact from SuDS installations reducing downstream flood risk.

---

## 🏘️ Hayes Walk (West of Site)
- **Noise:** Very close (26m); *Minor Adverse* during construction; negligible long-term traffic noise.
- **Landscape:** Visual change from open farmland to housing, with screening via trees.
- **Access:** Proximity to site traffic and bridleway may increase local activity during works.

---

## 🏘️ Chapelside & Whitethorns (Southeast)
- **Noise:** Highest construction traffic noise changes (~0.3 dB), but *Not Significant*.
- **Visual Impact:** Clear views toward the site; *Moderate Adverse* visual effect initially.

---

## 🏘️ End House & Barrington (Northeast)
- **Noise:** Slight daytime noise increases (~0.3–0.5 dB); *Negligible Impact* overall.
- **Air Quality:** Within legal thresholds.
- **Ecology:** Edge of impact zone; biodiversity improvements planned via buffer planting.

---

## 🌳 Western Edge & Bridleway (Burstow 481)
- **Ecology:** Hedgerow retention and new tree planting for habitat enhancement.
- **Noise:** Low construction noise expected.
- **Landscape:** Key views affected; *Moderate to Major Adverse* impacts expected early on.

---

## 🏫 Safeguarded School Site (East Central)
- **Noise:** Future school could generate *Minor Adverse* noise temporarily if built during main site works.
- **Ecology:** Low baseline value, but biodiversity net gain to be delivered via landscaping.
- **Land Use:** Not developed yet, but cumulative effects considered.

---

## 💧 Hydrology and Flooding (Site-wide)
- **Flood Risk Reduction:** New SuDS will hold ~12,000m³ of water.
- **Impact:** *Significant Beneficial* effect for existing flood-prone areas of Chapel Road and village centre.
