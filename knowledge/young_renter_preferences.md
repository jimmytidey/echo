## 🧠 Interpretation

Young renters are driven by:

- **Access to services and opportunities**: medical care, transport, jobs
- **Improved affordability**: either through rent or pathways to ownership
- **Desire for well-designed and well-built homes**

They care less about:
- Financial incentives to current residents
- Political mechanisms like developer contributions
- Design alone (unless it's paired with affordability and practicality)
