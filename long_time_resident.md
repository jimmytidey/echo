As a long-time resident of Smallfields, I have taken the time to review the documents regarding the proposed new development near Chapel Road. I have a few thoughts and concerns which I feel compelled to share as it could impact the quality of life for all of us who call this village home.

Firstly, I understand the need for development and housing, especially given current demands, but I believe it is crucial that any new development harmonizes with the existing character of our beloved village. Smallfields has a unique charm, with its picturesque landscapes and historic buildings that should be preserved and respected. Therefore, I would urge the developers to consider designs that complement our local architecture rather than imposing something jarring or out of place.

Moreover, I am concerned about the potential strain on local infrastructure. Our roads, especially those around Chapel Road, are already quite busy, and an influx of new residents could exacerbate congestion and safety concerns. There should be a comprehensive plan to address traffic flow and pedestrian safety, possibly including better footpaths or speed calming measures.

Another pressing issue is the availability of local amenities and services. Our community needs to ensure there is enough capacity in our local schools, medical facilities, and shops to accommodate new residents. Without proper investments in these areas, the development could lead to overstretched resources, leaving both existing and new residents underserved.

Finally, environmental considerations must be a priority. We should ensure green spaces are preserved or even incorporated into the new development, maintaining biodiversity and providing recreational areas for all age groups. Sustainable building practices should be applied, such as energy-efficient homes to minimize environmental impact.

In conclusion, while I am not entirely opposed to new developments, I believe careful consideration and planning must be given to preserve the essence of Smallfields, ensuring it remains a wonderful place to live for years to come.
