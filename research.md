Firstly, the overdevelopment of housing at the cost of green spaces is worrisome. We need to ensure any new builds respect our environment. The rising property taxes are unjust, particularly with the limited job opportunities in Smallfields. Overcrowdedness of our village school is another issue; without proper infrastructure, it would be difficult to absorb a large influx of new people. The village also lacks an efficient waste management system to handle a population surge. Finally, we must take preventative measures against excessive noise pollution and make sure our historical sites are preserved amidst new real estate developments. Striking a balance between developing for the future and preserving the past is crucial.
